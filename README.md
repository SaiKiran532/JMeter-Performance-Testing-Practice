# JMeter Performance Testing Practice Repository

Welcome to my JMeter performance testing practice repository! üöÄ In this repository, you'll find a collection of JMX files where I've practiced various aspects of performance testing using Apache JMeter. Below is a brief overview of what you'll find in this repository:

## Topics Covered:

1. **Thread Groups**: Created Thread Groups with different user scenarios to simulate realistic traffic on websites.
2. **Listeners**: Utilized various Listeners to analyze test results comprehensively and gain insights into performance metrics.
3. **Timers**: Implemented Timers to control the pacing of requests and simulate real-world scenarios.
4. **Controllers**: Explored different Controllers like Module Controller, Simple Controller, and Loop Controllers for organizing and managing test scenarios effectively.
5. **Test Fragments**: Utilized Test Fragments for modular and reusable test components to streamline test design.
6. **Throughput Controller**: Optimized performance testing with Throughput Controller to control the number of requests per second.
7. **Parameterization**: Mastered Parameterization techniques both internally (using User-defined variables) and externally (using .CSV files) for dynamic testing.
8. **Correlation**: Implemented Correlation with Regular Expressions to extract dynamic data from responses and use them in subsequent requests.
9. **Assertions**: Ensured test accuracy with various assertions including Response, Duration, Size, HTML, XML, and XPath.

10. **Config Elements**: Optimized test configurations for better performance.
11. **Database Test Plan**: Successfully created and executed a database test plan for comprehensive testing.
12. **FTP**: Explored FTP upload and download functionalities for end-to-end testing scenarios.
13. **REST API**: Conducted REST API testing for robust backend validation.
14. **JDBC**: Integrated JDBC for database connectivity and testing.
15. **HTML Reports**: Generated comprehensive HTML reports from the command line for in-depth analysis.


Additionally, I've also practiced API testing using the https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx  website to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Repository Structure:

- `jmx_files/`: Contains all the JMX files corresponding to the practice sessions.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Apache JMeter and load the desired JMX file to explore and run the performance test scenarios.
3. Feel free to modify the test scenarios or explore different configurations to deepen your understanding of performance testing with JMeter.

## Let's Connect!

I'm excited to share my journey and learning experience with performance testing using JMeter. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/challa-sai-kiran-18a2b8218/) to discuss more about performance testing, JMeter, or anything related to software testing and quality assurance.

Happy testing! üöÄüîç
